This package uses [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

ShadCN is an open source UI library for Next / React. Instead of conventional UI libraries, this library does not exist
in NPM. Which means that you don't update it via npm / package.json.

Instead, whenever you need a latest version of a UI component (say a Button) or a brand new UI component,
just navigate to that component's page in ShadCN website, and run the command, which pulls the component's code
into our repository. From there, the component's code is fully ours to own and update as required.

All components pulled by ShadCN are automatically added into the src/components/ui folder by ShadCN.

All custom components that we write should go into the src/components/custom folder.
